# PXL Image Format

> A simple image format for simple displaying the compatible terminal emulators.

Goals
-----

PXL was designed to be easy to display in a commandline environment. 
Currently there exists many methods of doing this, and hundreds of
tools. This spec aims to standardize the format of these ASCII escape
sequences based images.

Spec
----

* PXL relies heavily on ASCII escape sequences.
* Escape (`E`) is the  ESC (`0x1B` / `U+001B`)
* PXL newlines are an LF (`0x0A`).
* Each pixel character is the Unicode upper-half block (`0x2580`)
* ASCII escape code separator can be either `:` or `;` (or both).

Files
-----

A PXL file can be either encoded as ASCII or UTF-8. However, UTF-8 
is strongly preferred.

A PXL image file has the `.pxl` file extension.


Pixel
-----

A single 'pixel' is actually two pixels in PXL, using the old 
Unicode half-block trick.

```
E[48;2;RRR;GGG;BBBmE[38;2;RRR;GGG;BBBmâ–€
```

Lines
-----

Lines are comprised of multiple pixels joined without any 
spaces/delimiter. Lines always end with the following sequence:
```
E[0mE[BE[0G"
```
This sequence is required. It does three things:
- resets the color
- moves the cursor down one row
- moves the cursor to the first column in that row

MIME Type
---------

When transferring PXL images on the internet, the appropriate MIME type is
`image/pxl`.


ESC character
-------------

Most languages have a way to get the ESC character as a variable.

C:
```c
char e = '\x1B';
```

Rust:
```rust
const E: char = 0x1B as char
```

PowerShell:
```powershell
[char]$E = [char]0x1B
```

Bash: `'\e'`

F#:
```fsharp
let E: string = string (char 0x1B)
```
